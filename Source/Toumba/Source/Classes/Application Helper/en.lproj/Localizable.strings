"stadium_info" = "\nToumba Stadium:\n\nIt is not just a stadium. The PAOK faithful refer to it as the “Temple”. Toumba is so intricately associated with the club, that sometimes it becomes more important than the team itself! Toumba is the first word someone says with the mere mention of PAOK…\n\nThe legend of Toumba was created through 20 six-month instalments! The purchase cost (1,5 million drachmas) set by the Ministry of National Defence was paid in 75.000-drs instalments up until 1969…\n\nIn the late ‘50s, the needs of the club had multiplied. The crowds coming to the stadium to watch the team exceeded all expectations. Syntrivani Stadium was proving too small – PAOK could not remain there. Thus commenced the first attempt of the club to acquire a piece of land and build a new home ground. In 1957, the administration of the club appointed a special technical committee, responsible for the construction of a new stadium, mainly to find the land and the necessary funding. The area was found in Toumba, in a location owned by the National Defence Fund. Wing-commander Giorgos Themelis, then Minister of National Defence and also chairman of the aforementioned committee of the new stadium construction, granted the 7,5 acres (30.000 sq. metres) to the club.\n\nOn 7 February 1958, a committee of Third Army Corps officers delivered the land to Mr. Georgiadis and Mr. Sidiropoulos, representatives of PAOK FC. The following morning marked the start of a bold plan to build a stadium in record time. Construction works were completed in August 1959. The total cost amounted to 6 million drachmas, with just 1,1 million coming from the General Secretariat of Sports as subvention.\n\nThe inauguration of Toumba took place on 6 September 1959. The administration of PAOK invited AEK for a friendly match. The Double-Headed Eagle of the North prevailed 1-0, with Kostas Kiourtzis scoring the only goal. The Hellenic Football Federation (EPO) acknowledged the new stadium through the Act of 23.10.1959. Toumba was originally a 20.000-seat venue.\n\nSince its inauguration day, Toumba would change gradually. In 1966, a majestic main gate was added to the venue, the capacity was raised and the dressing rooms got expanded. In 1969, the capacity was increased further. A gymnasium was built under Gate 3, a track was added around the pitch and, in front of Gate 4, an open court was built for the basketball team of the club. A hefty sum of money was given for the installation of the floodlights – a work inaugurated on 20 May 1970.\n\nIn the early ‘70s, thanks to the efforts of Vassilis Sergianidis, Toumba became a 45.000-seater, one of the biggest stadia in the Balkans. For the European encounter against Barcelona, on 16 September 1975, 45.200 tickets were sold out!\n\nSince the mid-‘90s, the installation of plastic seats and the mandatory insertion of dead zones decreased Toumba’s capacity. The stadium underwent extensive renovation work, because of its use as training centre for the 2004 Olympic Games. The following works were completed on that occasion:\n\nA new metal roof and a new 4-storey building behind Gates 1, 2 and 3. This building offers all the modern amenities, such as suites and a VIP lounge, a media tribune with 120 seats, a media centre, a press conference room, offices etc.\n\nThere is a total of 14 suites (12 sq. meters each), located on the 3rd and 4th floor of the new building, that can accommodate five (5) persons each. The suites owners have their own (VIP) entrance and they have access to the luxurious VIP lounge of the stadium, which offers panoramic views to the pitch and over Thessaloniki.\n\n";
